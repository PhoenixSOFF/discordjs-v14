# HOW TO RUN

Depending on your choice use `npm i discord.js glob chalk dotenv`
or if you want to use yarn `yarn add discord.js glob chalk dotenv`( if you haven't installed yarn before `npm i yarn--global` )

Do not forget to write your bot's token, bot's id and your account's id to .env file.

After completing the setup write `node .` to your console opened at this directory.

If you want to restart the bot after saving automatically install `npm i nodemon --global` then use `nodemon .` to start the bot.
